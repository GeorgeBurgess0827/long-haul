	<p>Hello, My name is George! A Little Bit about myself, I graduated from college with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Since then I landed a full time role as a Software Engineer. Recently my role has changes to UX Engineer. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in UX design.</p>

	<p>My ambition is to one day become a very good at both Front-End Development as well as UX Design.
	With the combination of these two skill sets I will be able to design and build anything I want! but more realistically, I would be the perfect liaison between designers and developers.</p>
