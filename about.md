	<p>Hello, My name is George, I graduated from college with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Since then I landed a role as a Software Engineer. Recently, I completed my master's degree in UX design. Because of this, my role has changed to UX Engineer.</p>

	<p>My ambition is to one day become proficient at both Front-End Development as well as UX Design. 
With the combination of these two skill sets I will be able to design and build anything I want! But more realistically, I would be the perfect liaison between designers and developers.</p>
