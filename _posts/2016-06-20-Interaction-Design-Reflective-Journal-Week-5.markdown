<h3>Interactive Prototype Week 2</h3>

This was week 2 of creating the interactive prototype. I didn’t have much time to add much because work was really hectic this week. I’m proud of myself though. I was able to come up with a solution to my calendar problem and figured out how to add drop downs. I also started to get the hang of proto.io.

Seeing all the different versions that my classmates came up with was pretty cool. It gave me a lot of inspiration and ideas that i can use to improve my version. I expect some really late nights next week to meet the deadline but I’m excited.

So far I have done the following:

* Recreated my wireframes in Proto.io
*	Added navigation between the different screens.
*	Added transitions.
*	Added gesture controls (if you swipe right most pages will take to to the previous page).
*	Finished the all screens except for the subsidy page.
*	Added notes in Proto.io for some of the interactions


Here is a link to version 2!
