<h3>Planning a Design Evaluation</h3>

This week our task was to create a design evaluation or usability test for our prototypes.

we didn’t have to actually have to test our prototypes which is nice because it would’ve took forever to find participants. The process of creating the plan was not very difficult I created based of video from this week’s module as well as the email from the instructor.

Time to add to my portfolio piece!

This was the final week of our seven-week journey through Interaction design. I must say I really enjoyed this course. I am kind sad to see it end. Designing “Lunch Money Buddy” was really interesting and fun. It didn’t feel like an assignment at all.
