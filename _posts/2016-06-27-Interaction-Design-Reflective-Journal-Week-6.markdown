<h3>Interactive Prototype Week 3</h3>

This was the third and final week for our interactive prototypes. Our goals for this week was to finalize our prototype, Create a presentation, and create a portfolio piece. I Didn’t get chance to improve it as much as i wanted to because of long hours and strict deadlines at work (Life of an Software engineer). But I am proud of what i was able to complete.



I’m not sure if I did my presentation right so I went off what was said in the course slack group.

The presentation included:

*	Select Screenshots and Annotations for existing and intended interactions/functionality. *Annotations are also in Proto.io*
*	Rationale behind the design.
for the screenshots and annotations i cradted a powerepoint presetation. for the rationale i created a word document.

Here is the link to final version of my prototype: https://georgeburgess.proto.io/share/?id=41db408e-befc-41c0-8e30-0a280d4e739d&v=3

Our Teacher also sent out an email asking for feedback on new course structure they tried on us. which was:

The three-week timeframe and reliance on some of the peer feedback

In my Opinion, I thought it was really helpful and seeing other classmates suggestions and questions. It really made me think about my design and how i can improve it. Also it was really cool see other’s prototypes and helping fellow classmates that had issues. It made you feel like you had help and a sense of community. especially since we are all from different corners of everywhere.
