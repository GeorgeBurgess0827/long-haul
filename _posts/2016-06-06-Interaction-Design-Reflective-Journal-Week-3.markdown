<h3>Wireframing Part 2</h3>

This was the third week of the course. Our goal for this week was to finish up the sketches of our wireframes, seek feedback from our group members as well as give feedback, and create a final polished version of our wireframes.

I really enjoyed this week and I learned a lot! The group feedback was helpful and gave me a lot to think about when creating my prototype.i also feel like i gave good feedback as well. Using Balsmiq was a good choice in my opinion because it made everything clear and easy to see. For my Subsidy Page, I have not figured out exactly what I am going to put as far as information. but my group members gave me some good starting points.

Next week we begin creating our interactive prototype using proto.io. This should be interesting. I hope the learning curve isnâ€™t to bad.
