<h3>Interactive Prototype Week 1</h3>

This week I began creating the interactive protype.Proto.io gave me a headache at first! After a while i did begin to get the hang on it though. There are still things that I need to figure out. like how to add a calendar and dropdown menus. those will be my prioty for next week.

So far I have done the following:

* Recreated my wireframes in Proto.io
* Added navigation between the different screens.
* Added transitions.
* Added gesture controls (if you swipe right most pages will take to to the previous page).
* Here is the link to what i have so far.
